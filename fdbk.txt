Early grading, but.

1c contains no scalings. -2.5

```
I calculated how wide each column would be, and how many pixels corresponded a histogram value of one (one of the asterisks from above)
```
1c contains no such calculations, and altering the size of the histogram or window do not change the rendered graphic. Not that the bars do not fill the window in the code as provided.

2 unattempted. -2.5

5/10

Will recheck @ midnight.
